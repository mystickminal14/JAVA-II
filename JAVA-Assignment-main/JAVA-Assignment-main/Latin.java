/*Write a program that starts with the string variable first set to your first name
and the string variable last set to your last name. Both names should be all
lowercase.
Your program should then create a new string that contains your full name
in pig latin with the first letter capitalized for the first and last name. Use
only the pig latin rule of moving the first letter to the end of the word and
adding “ay.” Output the pig latin name to the screen. Use the substring
and toUpperCase methods to construct the new name.
For example, given
first = &quot;walt&quot;;
last = &quot;savitch&quot;;
the program should create a new string with the text “Altway Avitchsay” and
print it.*/
