/*A simple rule to estimate your ideal body weight is to allow 110 pounds for
the first 5 feet of height and 5 pounds for each additional inch. Write a
program with a variable for the height of a person in feet and another
variable for the additional inches. Assume the person is at least 5 feet tall.
For example, a person that is 6 feet and 3 inches tall would be represented
with a variable that stores the number 6 and another variable that stores the
number 3. Based on these values, calculate and output the ideal body
weight.*/
