//Amend the skeleton program on the next page so that:
1. It contains a constant for the conversion of gallons into litres. (1 gallon = 4.546 litres).
2. It contains a gallons variable which is initialised to 14.
3. It contains a litres variable.
4. It contains a String initialised to "The number of litres in ".
5. It contains a String initialised to " gallons is ". Note spaces!
6. It contains the assignment : litres variable = gallons variable * conversion constant.
7. It outputs the first String concatenated with the gallons variable, concatenated with the
second String concatenated with the litres variable.//
